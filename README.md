## ðŸ‘‹ About Me :
    I am a data scientist and machine learning engineer, with a background in physics. Understanding and analyzing 
    data is my passion. I am currently seeking new opportunities in Texas or remotely, but I would be open to discuss 
    any other opportunities out of the area. I have a strong background in mathematics, research, Python, SQL, APIs, 
    AWS, Docker, and experience in Java. My past experience in research has given me the expertise to understand and 
    break-down problems, using first-principles thinking. Combining my scientific training and experience in machine 
    learning and artificial intelligence, I strive to solve even the most difficult of problems. Working in an applied 
    physics laboratory has taught me how to succinctly deliver and communicate results to large groups of people.
    I also have many years in the communications industry, and this has given me the confidence and know-how to 
    communicate effectively one-on-one.
