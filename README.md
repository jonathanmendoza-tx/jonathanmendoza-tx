## ðŸ‘‹ About Me :
    A dynamic data scientist and machine learning engineer, I fuse my strong foundation in physics and mathematics 
    with a passion for understanding and analyzing data. My trajectory from the University of Texas at San Antonio 
    to prominent roles in aerospace technology and applied research illustrates my commitment to first-principles 
    thinking and my proficiency in Python, SQL, APIs, AWS, Docker, and other software tools.

    My rigorous experience in research, notably with UTSA Nanomaterials Lab, has enriched my ability to dissect and 
    solve multifaceted problems. Harnessing my scientific training, coupled with my expertise in machine learning 
    and artificial intelligence, I remain poised to tackle even the most challenging conundrums. This approach is 
    enhanced by my years in the communications industry, equipping me with the skillset to effectively convey complex 
    results both in group settings and one-on-one interactions. My diverse roles, from research to IT and finance, 
    underscore my ability to align tech solutions with diverse business needs.

    Currently, I'm on the lookout for fresh challenges, preferably in or around Longmont, CO or remote roles. 
    However, I'm always open to exciting opportunities irrespective of location. For a deeper dive into my recent 
    endeavors, I invite you to explore my work on
